In SAFe, the four types of backlogs are:

- **Team Backlog:** Contains stories, bugs, and technical tasks for individual teams, focusing on local execution.
- **Program Backlog:** Includes features and enablers for multiple teams within an Agile Release Train (ART).
- **Solution Backlog:** Focuses on capabilities and large-scale enablers for Solution Trains, spanning multiple ARTs.
- **Portfolio Backlog:** The highest level, containing epics that align with long-term business strategy.

The main differences lie in scope (from tactical teamwork to strategic initiatives) and ownership (from Product Owners to Lean Portfolio Management).

Safe vs waterfall:
+ safe is iterative, adaptive, incremental value delivery, frequent feedback, course steering corrections
+ waterfall is linear, rigid process, each phase complete before moving on, delaying value delivery, making steering changes difficult
