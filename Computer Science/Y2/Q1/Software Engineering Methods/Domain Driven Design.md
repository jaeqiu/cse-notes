Domain == the space that the problem exists in

Ubiquitous language is an agreed-upon and continually evolving set of terminologies that bridge domain jargon and technical jargon, allowing domain experts and technical experts to communicate effectively about the software in development. The ubiquitous language should be used in every aspect of the project, from meetings to code.

System Description
	examples:

### Queue

---

Queue is a web application that allows students to create requests to engage with teaching assistants. Students are part of courses, which have labs corresponding to times and locations of instruction hours related to the course. A student creates a request which is then placed in that lab’s queue. The request in the front of the queue can be accepted by a teaching assistant belonging to the relevant course, at which point the teaching assistant goes to the student to assist with the reason for their request.

### Submit

---

Submit is an application allowing students to upload submissions to assignments and receive feedback based on their submission. Assignments belong to courses and are defined by course staff. Course staff define properties of the assignment including the rules by which the automatic feedback is generated. Teaching assistants can also give manual feedback on a submission.

### TAM

---

TAM is a web application enabling lecturers to find and hire teaching assistants for their courses. Lecturers can post listings for their courses providing information about the position. Prospective teaching assistants (applicants) can then apply to these job offers, potentially providing additional information. Lecturers can then accept or reject these applications. Accepted applicants then accept or reject the resulting offer to choose to become a teaching assistant for the course.
