- Some open-source projects are not free to use; some charge for licensing
    
- Some open-source licenses restrict commercial use or require sharing modifications.
    
- Open-source can be as secure as proprietary software, since open code allows for public review and benefits from many eyes catching bugs and vulnerabilities.
    
- Open-source software often has (community) support.
    
- Open-source software may face compatibility issues with proprietary systems.  
    Compatibility varies, and open-source isnâ€™t immune to integration challenges with closed systems.

	definite dealbreakers:
	licensing
	compatibility

	sometimes dealbreakers:
	popularity in stars
	open source devs maintenance or support

	definitely not a dealbreaker:
	how polished ux is
	complex setting up
