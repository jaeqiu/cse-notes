[[SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework)]] vs Waterfall:
+ Waterfall is a linear, rigid process, each phase completes before moving on, delaying value delivery, making steering changes difficult. This inadaptability makes it unfit for [[VUCA]] settings.
+ [[SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework)]] is iterative, adaptive, incremental value delivery, [[Frequent delivery]], course steering corrections
