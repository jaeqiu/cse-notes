Engineers need to design without being prejudiced.
![[Ethics 2024-11-06 15.14.10.excalidraw]]Ethics: reflection on "normal"

Morality
Descriptive morality: created codes of conduct
Normative morality: "normal" code of conduct (normal meaning all rational people would independently come to this conclusion)

Focal points:
Agent: people as outcome
Action: the action itself as outcome
Consequence: the consequence as outcome

Ethical theories:
Deontology: focus on duty/principle, not self-interest
Utilitarianism: consequence, "for the greater good"
Virtue ethics: agent-focused, about character development



Engineers are moral agents
Moral agents can be held accountable for their actions because they have the ability to tell right from wrong.
Moral patients can be mistreated by moral agents
Capacity to make a choice -> be held accountable for it

Passive responsibility: meet basic standards
Active responsibility: take initiative

Algorithmic ethics:
Epistemic values:
Knowledge
Objectivity
Accuracy
Simplicity
Robustness

Non-Epistemic values:
moral
social

Non-epistemic values can be legitimate, even though implicitly biased sometimes:
- choice of research
- application of results
- assess scientific model
- assess theories
- assess hypotheses

Bias: inclination towards something, with a tendency to ignore the merits of relevant alternatives/other pov's

Fairness: give everyone equal consideration/opportunity to a buff like privacy/free speech/basic goods

Takeaway: prevent biases from undermining our fairness idea.

Challenge: proxy bias
a proxy variable can operate as a substitute for a variable of interest
proxy bias: bias by using a proxy variable

Fairness methods:
- Outcome-fair: the outcome is "fair"
- Process-fair: the process is "fair"

Holistic view: view of the whole thing
Positionality: An attempt at a holistic view will be influenced by your positionality

Disparity: unfair difference

ROC Receiver Operating Characteristic curve: model performance across all thresholds
AUC Area Under roc Curve: probability that the model will rank a positive example higher than the negative example
