### OOP Design Principles → SOLID

To make OOP designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable:

- **Single Responsibility:** one class, one responsibility.
- **Open-Close:** open for extension, closed for modification.
- **Liskov Substitution:** subclasses can substitute superclass, preserving superclass behavior.
- **Interface Segregation:** division into specific interfaces; clients aren’t forced to depend on interfaces they don’t use.
- **Dependency Inversion:** objects depend on abstractions, not concretes.
