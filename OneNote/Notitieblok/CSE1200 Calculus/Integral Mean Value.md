**Mean Value Theorem**
 
The mean value theorem states that the area we calculate using an integral can be represented with a rectangle of the same area, sharing the same base as the bound of our integral, but with a height equal to the mean value of the integral. If the area of an integral is ice, this mean value theorem can be visualized as that ice melting, taking the form of a rectangle
