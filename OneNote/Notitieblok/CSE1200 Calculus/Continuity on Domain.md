- **What is continuity? When is something continuous and how is it connected to limits?**
    
    - Continuity is when a graph of a function contains no holes or jumps. A function is continuous when you can approach each point of the function from the left and from the right with limits. If you can't approach each point with the limits from left and right, then it is not continuous.
