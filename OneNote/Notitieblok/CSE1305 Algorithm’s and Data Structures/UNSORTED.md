- **Containers**
- **Search trees**
- **Ordered data structures**
- **Hash tables**
- **Graph data structures**
 
**Algo design and analysis pattern:**

- **Recursion**
- **Divide and conquer**
- **Prune and search**
 
**Algorithms rely on appropriate data input.**
 
**What is a data structure?**
 
**What is time and space complexity? They determine which algorithm you will use in an implementation.**
