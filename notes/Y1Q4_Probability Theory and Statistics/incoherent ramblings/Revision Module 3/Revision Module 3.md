### Boxplot Questions
- **The IQR in this boxplot is 8. Based on this, a good estimate for ùúé** **is approximately:**

    Solution:
    
    ![Untitled 2 16.png](../../../../attachments/Untitled%202%2016.png)
    
    by reverse lookup of the standard normal distribution‚Äôs Z table output we find that the probability .25 comes from an x greater than .67, Therefore the interquartile range is the range from $-.67\sigma$ until $.67\sigma$, or $1.34\sigma$. (sigma represents the scaling factor going from the standard normal distribution to the actual distribution).  
    Since the IQR is 8, given in the question, we end up with the equation $8 = 1.34\sigma$ giving $\sigma = 6$.
