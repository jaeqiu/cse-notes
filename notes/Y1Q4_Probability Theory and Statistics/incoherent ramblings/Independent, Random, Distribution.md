# ==Event Independence, Random Variable (Discrete), Distribution (Discrete)==
## Independent Events

> Events are independent if, knowing one event to be true doesn’t affect the probability of the other event.  
>   
> Defined as: the likelyhood of the intersection is the same as the product of individual probabilities

## Discrete Random Variable

> A discrete random variable works off of a sample space and assigns each event to a value, finite or infinite.

## Probability Mass Function

> A Probability Mass Function returns the probability mass of an event, given the underlying discrete random variable

## Distribution Function, Probability Mass Function for Discrete RV

> The distribution takes the probability-mass and returns between 0 and 1, representing the probability of the associated event, from the value.

## Combinations - Notation

> The notation for a combination of “any distinct 3 of 12” looks like $\begin{pmatrix}12 (options) \\3 (picks)\end{pmatrix}$
