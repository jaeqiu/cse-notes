## Confidence Interval

> [!important]
### Critical Value

> ![[Untitled 82.png]]
- be aware of twin/single tails when computing the critical value
    - At first i thought we should halve the significance level .05 to obtain the right tail probability .025, before looking up the critical value for such a probability.  
        The reason why we should not do this, is because H1 states mu greater than 84, not â‰ , so it only has one tail
