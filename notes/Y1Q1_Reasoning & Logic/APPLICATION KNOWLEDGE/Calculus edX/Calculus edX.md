### Polynomials

> A calculator can only perform two mathematical operations, addition and multiplication, but using only these two operations a large class of functions called polynomial functions can be constructed.  
>   
> A polynomial is a function that can be constructed from a variable and a set of numbers using only addition and multiplication.  
>   
> The standard form of a polynomial is a sum of terms where each term is a product of a number and x raised to some integer power.  
>   
> The terms are ordered from high power to low. The degree of a polynomial is the highest power that occurs in the standard form.  
>   
> The degree provides information about the behavior of a polynomial function as x becomes large or small.  
>   
> A calculator is good at evaluating polynomial functions but it cannot evaluate functions like sine, cosine, logarithms, square roots, etc.  
>   
> These functions can be approximated using polynomials. -gpt
