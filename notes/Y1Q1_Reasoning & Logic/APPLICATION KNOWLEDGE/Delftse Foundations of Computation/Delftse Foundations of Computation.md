- explanation
    
    just invert it
    
    both have to be true
    
    either has to be true (both counts)
    
    either has to be true, but not both
    
    if the first one is true, the second HAS to be true (but if the second is true, itâ€™s not necessarily because the first was true) 1 0 is illegal because the first makes the second true. 0 1 is legal because the second can be true for other reasons
    
    both need to have the same value (either one being 1, makes the other 1 too, so 1 0 and 0 1 are illegal, and for 0 0 neither is 1 so you havent done anything, but that doesnt make it false.)
