**Definition of Limit:**  
f defined around a, maybe not a  
lim of f tends to a is L  
lim f(x) = L  
x -> a
 
if for every ε > 0, we can find δ > 0 such that  
( 0 < | x - a | < δ **implies** | f(x) - L | < ε )
 
_The limit_ **DNE** if no such L exists.
 
**Template of Proof of Limit:**  
Given epsilon,  
choose δ = (respect to epsilon)￼suppose 0 < |x-a| < δ  
check |f(x) - L|
 
**Last Remarks**  
the symbols can be confusing, but what it says in laymans terms is that however positively small you take the y-tolerance epsilon, there still exists a positive delta such that a maximum deviation from a of delta still computes to a y that is within epsilon far away from L.  
the reason for 0 < |x-a| is that if the deviation is 0, we are exactly at x=a, meaning the function isn't defined in case x=a is an asymptote or perforation.
