- **How to find the inverse of a function and when is a function an inverse of another function?**
    
    - A function is the inverse of another function if and only if f(x) = y and g(y) = x. Filling in the inverse function for x in the function f(x), must result in x, and vice versa. A function is only invertible when it is one-to-one, you have to modify the domain if that is not the case.
