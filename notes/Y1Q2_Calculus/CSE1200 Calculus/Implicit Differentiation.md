**Curves, Implicit- and Explicit Functions**  
Not all curves, describing a relation between x and y, can be defined as y of an explicit function of x, since not all curves are injective, and can therefore not be explicit functions.

The left is not a functino, since it is not injective.  
We can only use implicit differentiation here.
 
**Graph of a circle**  
The graph of a circle can not be defined as y = f(x) where f(X) is an explicit function, since an explicit function is injective, and for the graph of a circle we have an upper and lower half.  
It can however be defined implicitly as two separate explicit functions, one for each half.

When taking the derivative of each explicit function, they can once again be defined as the same function, one single function.
 
**Implicit Differentiation**  
What if we can short circuit that? What if we can take the derivative of an curve, without first dividing it into multiple explicit functions?  
It seems that for implicit differentiation of 3xy with respect to dx, we compute 3y + 3x dy/dx, this was confusing to me.
