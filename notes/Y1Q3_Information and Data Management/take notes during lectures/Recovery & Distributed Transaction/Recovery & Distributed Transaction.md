> "Recovery from System Failures: Ensuring Atomicity and Durability"
---
## Introduction
- Recovery ensures atomicity and durability of transactions.
- Focus: Handling system failures to maintain database consistency.
## Failure Modes
- Transaction failure, system failure, and media failure.
- Each requires specific recovery mechanisms.
## Logging
- Crucial for ensuring atomicity.
- Log records capture transaction events for recovery.
- Types: Undo logging, redo logging, undo/redo logging.
## Undo Logging
- Focuses on undo operations in case of system failure.
- Records changes before transaction commits for rollback.
## Log Records
- Include transaction ID, element modified, old value, operation type.
## Rules of Undo Logging
- Write log records before corresponding database changes.
- Commit records written after all changes on disk.
## Recovery Process
- Examination of log file.
- Applying undo operations for uncommitted transactions.
## Example
- Demonstrates undo logging process in practice.
- Sequential actions during transaction execution and recovery steps.

## Summary
- Recovery mechanisms ensure atomicity and durability.
- Log records capture transaction events for recovery.
- Undo logging focuses on undo operations pre-commit.
- Rules ensure effective undo logging.
- Recovery involves examining the log file and applying undo operations.
- Example illustrates the undo logging process in practice.
