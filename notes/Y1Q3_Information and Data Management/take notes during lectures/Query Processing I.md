# Lecture Notes on Query Processing

> Main Takeaway:  
> Understanding query processing is crucial in database management systems (DBMS). This involves indexing structures for efficient query execution, binary trees, B+ trees, and multidimensional indexes. The lecture also touches upon the concept of query optimization, which involves finding the most efficient way to execute a query.  
## Index Structures
- A good index structure supports queries as efficiently as possible.
- Hash Indexes and B+ Trees support single equality condition.
- B+ Trees support range conditions efficiently, while Hash indexes do not.
## Query Processor
- The Query Processor is responsible for answering queries.
- It uses a simple view of a DBMS consisting of Disks, DBMS, Query Processor, Storage Manager, Transaction Manager, and Applications.
## Query Optimization
- Query optimization involves finding the 'optimal' way of executing a query.
- Two types of query optimization:
    - Heuristic-Based Optimization: Very easy and cheap but result quality varies a lot.
    - Cost-Based Optimization: Typically provides better results than heuristic-based but requires a good cost metric and cost function.
## Heuristic Optimization
- Uses rules which commonly lead to good results.
- Examples: Replacing a cartesian product with a join, converting a subquery into a join, selecting tuples as early as possible, projecting attributes as early as possible.
## Cost-Based Optimization
- Requires a Cost Estimation Function to express the cost of a query.
- Needs a way to enumerate alternative query plans.
## Query Execution
- Query optimization determines the best order of the relational algebra operators and the best implementation of each operator.
