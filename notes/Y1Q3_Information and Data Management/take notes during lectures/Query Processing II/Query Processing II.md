# Query Optimization - subtopic)
  
## Static vs Dynamic Plans
### Static Plans

> static plans use a pre-optimized statement which can be evaluated immediately given an unoptimized query (table)
### Dynamic Plans

> the best plan is found during run-time for queries
### Hybrid plan

> static plans are used in combination with fine-tuning thereof during runtime
## Optimization Example
### canonical operator tree to final operator tree
based on:
- heuristic query optimizations
- cost-based query optimization
## Algebraic Query Rewriting
### Selection $\sigma$
- cascading
![[Untitled 116.png|Untitled 116.png]]
- commuting
![[Untitled 1 18.png|Untitled 1 18.png]]
### Projection $\pi$
- cascading
![[Untitled 2 17.png|Untitled 2 17.png]]
- commuting
![[Untitled 3 13.png|Untitled 3 13.png]]
### Join, Cartesian Product
- commuting
![[Untitled 4 12.png|Untitled 4 12.png]]
- associating
![[Untitled 5 12.png|Untitled 5 12.png]]

> arbitrary order
- construct a join from a selection and a cartesian product
![[Untitled 6 12.png|Untitled 6 12.png]]
- commuting a selection over sides to a join/cartesian product
![[Untitled 7 12.png|Untitled 7 12.png]]
- commute projection over sides of a join/cartesian product
![[Untitled 8 10.png|Untitled 8 10.png]]
### Set operation
- commute $\cup$ and $\cap$
![[Untitled 9 9.png|Untitled 9 9.png]]
- associate $\cap$ and $\cap$
![[Untitled 10 8.png|Untitled 10 8.png]]
- commute $\sigma$ over a set operator
![[Untitled 11 7.png|Untitled 11 7.png]]
- commute $\pi$ over a set operator
![[Untitled 12 5.png|Untitled 12 5.png]]
## Heuristics (Rules of Thumb)

> heuristics are common mental shortcuts to make it easier to work through problems. In this context, heuristics involve a number of common optimizations that _**usually**_ result in a desirable operator tree
### detour: they don’t always work (just rules of thumb)
![[Untitled 13 5.png|Untitled 13 5.png]]
### 6 heuristics
### Break a selection $\sigma$ into multiple parts

> sometimes, a composite selection $\sigma$ should be broken down into a cascade of selections, so that they may be distributed over the operator tree
### Push selection $\sigma$ to an earlier moment

> make sure to push selections $\sigma$ to the earliest moment that they can afford to be placed, to relieve intermediate results
### Break, eliminate, push, introduce projection $\pi$

> break up (cascade into small parts)
> 
> eliminate unnecessary (remove projections $\pi$ if they are no longer needed to lower intermediate costs)
> 
> push down (push projections to the earliest moment that they can afford to be introduced
> 
> introduce (reintroduce the projection in the appropiate place)
### Collect selections $\sigma$ and projections $\pi$

> never have selections follow after projections
> 
> $\sigma_a\pi_b\sigma_c\pi_d = \pi_{bd}\sigma_{ac}$()
### Combine selection $\sigma_{condition}$ and cartesian product $\square\times\square$ into a join $\square\bowtie_{condition}\square$

> the idea is that a cartesian product $\times$ followed by a selection $\sigma$ can always be replaced by a theta join (join on condition)
### Prepare a block of unary operators for pipelining thereof

> a multitude of unary operations in immediate succession can be pipelined.
  
# Join Order Optimization
## Extreme amount of join order options
![[Untitled 14 5.png|Untitled 14 5.png]]
![[Untitled 15 5.png|Untitled 15 5.png]]
number of possible join orders grows very quickly (catalan function)
## Build Relation vs Probe Relation (in a join)

> By convention, the left relation is called the build relation, whereas the right relation is called the probe relation, with the probe relation being larger than the build relation.
## Join Algorithms

> The chosen algorithm determines which join case to use (what the build and probe relation do)
> 
> ### Block Nested Loop Join
> 
> outer loop probe inner loop build (the smaller build relation can be loaded into memory and serve as the inner loop)
> 
> ### Single Pass Join
> 
> ???
> 
> ### Index Join
> 
> outer loop build inner loop probe (this becomes viable when the inner looped probe relation is indexed.

## Left Deep Join Tree

> Compound indexes, don’t start fresh
> 
> ![[Untitled 18 4.png|Untitled 18 4.png]]
> 
> In order to minimize the size of intermediate results, R < S < T < U (smaller relations are joined first)
> 
> - good for decreasing build relation (smol one) size
> - nice buffer usage
> - pipeline-compatible
> - compatible with single pass, nested loop

> 
> CANT DO SORT MERGE JOINS
> 
> - successfully decrease join order contenders
> - BUT still a lot when ridiculous amounts of joins
> - BUT can’t do parallel execution :(
