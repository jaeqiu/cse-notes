[PCA Principal Component Analysis](PCA%20Principal%20Component%20Analysis.md)
Advantages:
- Useful for modeling feature interactions in multivariate datat
- Efficient compute
Disadvantages:
- Assumes that anomalies and normal data are distinguishable, after reducing dimensionality
- Does not take context into account
- PCA is sensitive to outliers (outliers influence variance a lot)
