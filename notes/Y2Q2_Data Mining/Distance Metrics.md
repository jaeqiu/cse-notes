Distance metrics suffice the following properties:

Non negative
Identity
Symmetry
Triangle inequality

problem with shortest path as similarity in taxonomy structure:
- the same level does not guarantee the same level of descriptiveness (by the nature of the depth being set by the amount of leaves, it could occur that traversing in a different direction in a node increases detailedness at a different rate)
- ????????????

- **Metric**   ⟹  always satisfies triangle inequality.
- **Non-metric**   ⟹   _not guaranteed_ to satisfy it.
