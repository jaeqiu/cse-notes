Assumes
- Relationships between variables to be linear (Covariance is a bilinear operator)
- Direction with largest variance to be most informative
- Principal Components to be orthogonal/linearly independent/linearly uncorrelated (Even though they could be statistically correlated)

Advantages:
- Fast compute,  Easy to interpret, works well in many cases
Disadvantages:
- Assumes orthogonality, linearity
