Manifold learning can capture nonlinear correlations between variables/features. 

Manifold Hypothesis: The dataset we are working with contains a lot of "unnecessary dimensions'. We assume our data lies on a low-dimensional manifold (/set of manifolds), embedded in a high-dimensional space

Advantages:
- Capture nonlinear relations
- Represents non-Euclidean structures
- Preserve local structures while reducing dimensionality

Disadvantages:
- Expensive compute
- Hyperparameter sensitive
- Distort global distances (for the sake of local neighborhoods)
