#### UML Sequence Diagram

  Displays a step-by-step for a particular action, highlighting objects:

  - **Actor:** something outside of the scope of the system.
  - **Object:** something inside the system.
  - **Synchronous Message:** communication between actors and objects or objects and objects.
  - **Return Message (dashed):** the response to a synchronous message.
  - **Lifeline (box):** the activity lifeline of an object (not an actor).
  - **Combined Fragment; Alternative:** an if-else statement where both statements overlap in real-time but are displayed sequentially to depict alternative paths.
