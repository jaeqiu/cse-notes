While the quick and dirty solution got your product the market, you incur penalty later. It becomes more difficult to make adjustments to the software system.

Technical Debt snowballs: Broken windows theory; visible signs of crime encourages more crime.

Intrinsic complexity:** The essential complexity that is required to solve the problem (e.g. Big-oh time of sorting algorithms.

Additional complexity** or **cruft** is added to complete the implementation quickly. This “cruft” makes it **harder to understand and maintain the software.**

Code smells are not bugs, they are not technically incorrect and do not prevent the program from functioning (”maintainability defect” versus “functional defect”)

Maintainability defects:
+ lead to future maintainance/understanding issues
+ can lead to functional defects
+ are sometimes not worth fixing
+ can not be caught with jUnit tests.
