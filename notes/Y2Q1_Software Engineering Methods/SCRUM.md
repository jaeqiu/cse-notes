Short-cycled sprints
+ transparency: the entire project is clear to all
+ inspection: checking project progression, quality
+ adaptation: changes allowed. This directly combats VUCA, because adaptation allows a high-level steering towards a more suitable solution for the changing VUCA setting.

identified through: timeboxed iterative delivery, predefined events, prescribed roles and artifacts

The Product Owner (PO) is responsible for maximizing the value of the product resulting from the team’s work. They bridge the gap between the development team and stakeholders, ensuring that the team’s efforts align with customer and business needs. The PO adjusts priorities of tasks based on the stakeholder’s constantly adjusting requirements.

1. Transparency:
    
    - open communication
    - clear understanding of project goals, processes, and progress
    - reduces misunderstandings
    - increases trust and collaboration
2. Inspection:
    
    - Regular reviews of the team’s progress (such as sprint reviews and retrospectives)
    - help identify issues, areas for improvement, and strengths.
    - can catch errors early
3. Adaptation:
    
    - based on the insights gained from inspections
    - can quickly adjust plans, processes, or approaches
    - helps the team stay resilient, address challenges proactively
    - continuously improve

#### What is the Sprint Backlog?

**Sprint Backlog** = a list of tasks, user stories, and items that the team commits to completing during a specific sprint.

#### Who’s Responsible for Creating It?

- The **Development Team** is primarily responsible for creating the Sprint Backlog. During the **Sprint Planning** meeting, they select the Product Backlog items they believe they can complete in the sprint and break them down into smaller, actionable tasks.
- The **Product Owner** prioritizes the Product Backlog and ensures clarity on the items.
- The **Scrum Master** facilitates the planning process.

Product Backlog = list of all (unresolved) tasks, not necessarily for the upcoming spring
#### Sprint Review

Main Focus: assessing what was accomplished during the sprint and gathering feedback on the product. It is also used for adapting the Product Backlog if necessary and ensuring the product continues to meet stakeholder needs.

#### Sprint Retrospective

Main Focus: reviewing how the team worked together during the sprint. It’s a time for the team to reflect on their processes, collaboration, and overall effectiveness. The aim is continuous improvement by identifying what went well, what didn’t, and creating actionable plans.
