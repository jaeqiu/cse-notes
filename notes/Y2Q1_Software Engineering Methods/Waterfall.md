[SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework)](SAFe%20(Scaled%20Agile%20Framework).md) vs Waterfall:
+ Waterfall is a linear, rigid process, each phase completes before moving on, delaying value delivery, making steering changes difficult. This inadaptability makes it unfit for [VUCA](VUCA.md) settings.
+ [SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework)](SAFe%20(Scaled%20Agile%20Framework).md) is iterative, adaptive, incremental value delivery, [Frequent delivery](Frequent%20delivery.md), course steering corrections
