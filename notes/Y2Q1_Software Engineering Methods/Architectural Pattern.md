## Architectural Patterns

Choosing an architectural pattern is a tradeoff. Each pattern differs in the following qualities:

- **Performance:** system response time
- **Usability:** ease of use
- **Maintainability:** ease of maintenance
- **Testability:** ease of verification
- **Reusability:** can components be reused?
- **Availability:** is the system available when needed?
- **Integrity:** can unauthorized users get in and change data?
