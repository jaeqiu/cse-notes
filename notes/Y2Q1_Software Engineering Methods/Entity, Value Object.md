entity
object has life cycle
object has identity (remains same during change)
might be mutable
unique even when other object same attributes
- can have different states
- not defined by their attributes
- e.g: Customer, Transaction, Orders
	example
	shopping order
	shop product
	- distinct identity that runs through time (identity operation)



value object
object can't change
any change means new object
immutable
identity is literally attributes
