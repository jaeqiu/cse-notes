It is important to look at a system from different views, instead of including all information in one diagram.

Different stakeholders have different things they care about. It is important to share with them a view that shows the parts they care about, while abstracting over/not showing parts of your design that arenâ€™t relevant to them.

That way, they can share their expertise and fix misconceptions in the design, without overwhelming them with information that could hinder that process.

If you were to try and put all information about your architectural design in a single image, it will become illegible.
