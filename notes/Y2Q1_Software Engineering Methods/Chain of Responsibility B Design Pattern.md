 **Chain of Responsibility B:** Any handler object can decide to process or pass (default).

 This is like the CoR A but instead of a unanimous green light we just want someone/anyone to take one for the team (usually pass to a low-level, more specialized subclass object, like finding a grad student to do all ur research work)

 We have a request that is propagated along a chain in a specific order. If a handler cannot satisfy the request (item not available at that location), it should propagate the request. Otherwise, it should handle the request and stop the propagation.
