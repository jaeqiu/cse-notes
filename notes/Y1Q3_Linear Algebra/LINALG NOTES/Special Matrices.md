# Special Matrices
- **Zero Matrix**: A matrix in which all entries are zero.
- **Square Matrix**: A matrix with an equal number of rows (m) and columns (n), forming a square shape. The main diagonal of a square matrix includes all entries where the row number is the same as the column number (denoted as $a_{ii}$).
- **Diagonal Matrix** (must be square): A matrix in which all off-diagonal entries are zero.
- **Identity Matrix** (must be square): A matrix that is all zeroes except for 1's on the main diagonal. It is a type of diagonal matrix with only 1's for the main diagonal entries.
- **Lower Triangular Matrix** (must be square): A matrix where all entries above the main diagonal are zero. The term 'lower' refers to the populated, not-necessarily-zero part of the matrix.
- **Upper Triangular Matrix** (must be square): A matrix where all entries below the main diagonal are zero. The term 'upper' refers to the populated, not-necessarily-zero part of the matrix.
