# Rank Theorem
Rank(A) + Dim(Null(A)) = column count since the column count  
signifies the input vector dimension, and the rank the output, the  
difference constitutes the dimensions that we’re lost. all these lost  
dimensions are equal to dim(null(a)) since the null space will take the  
form of the entire subspace that compute to the zero vector after the  
linear transformation of matrix A # Basis Theorem >  
**Theorem:** > Let W be a p-dimensional subspace of Rn.  
Then:  

> 1. Any linearly independent set of exactly p elements in W is a  
basis for W. > 2. Any set of exactly  p elements in W that spans W is  
a basis for W.  
what this means in normal human language is that any set of vectors  
that are linearly independent (= nonredundant) are valid basis vectors  
for the subspace in Rn dimensions, with n being the amount of vectors in  
the set i just talked about.
