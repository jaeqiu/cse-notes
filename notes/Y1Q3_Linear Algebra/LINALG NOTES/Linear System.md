Linear system
- how many solutions does a system of linear equations have?
- is this linear system consistent?
- what echelon form is this matrix in?
- how does echelon form determine number of solutions for a given  
    system of linear equations?  
    
- how can I solve a consistent linear system from a reduced echelon  
    form by selecting the free variables and express the basic variables in  
    terms of such free variables?
