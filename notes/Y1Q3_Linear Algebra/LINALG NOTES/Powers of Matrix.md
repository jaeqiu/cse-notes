Since in a multiplication AB the  
result has the amount of rows from A, the amount of columns from B, and  
the amount of columns from A needs to match the amount of rows from B.  
When multiplying A by A as in AA, the rows and columns need to match,  
therefore powers of a matrix are only possible for square matrices (of n  
x n) A^0 = I, with I meaning the identity matrix (zeroes across the  
board except for a diagonal of 1â€™s)
