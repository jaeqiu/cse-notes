Negative logit correspond to probabilities less than 0.5, positive to > 0.5.\n\n**In ML**, it [can be](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary/#logits)\n\n> the vector of raw (non-normalized) predictions that a classification model generates, which is ordinarily then passed to a normalization function. If the model is solving a multi-class classification problem, logits typically become an input to the softmax function. The softmax function then generates a vector of (normalized) probabilities with one value for each possible class.\n\n**Logits also** [sometimes](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary/#logits) refer to the element-wise inverse of the sigmoid function."}
