# Pre History
The Lecturer explains how computers can do human things, quickly.  
Computers are fast  
Computers don’t get headaches  
  
Mechanical devices
No memory or program
Leibniz already used binary system
A single operation at a time, and only simple operations ( + - x / )
Examples of Computers throughout history
Mechanical Music Instruments
Chess
Weaving Machines
Difference Engine
Charles Babbage
Designed Analytical Engine
Inspired by jaquard and von muller
never completed
Conceptually
Arithmetic unit + Memory + I/O devices + IF’s
First machine with stored-program concept (calculations + order sequences)
Analog Computers
Nomogram
Slide rule
Mechanical integrators
First systems that enabled significant reduction of calculation times
  
Electro-mechanical devices are much faster.
Made to be 100 times faster than by hand.
3-5 times faster (component failures)
  
Power wall → can’t go from GHz to THz because it would generate heat.
