**Calculate the area under an irregular function.**  
Sometimes a function doesn't take the the shape of a regular form, meaning we cant calculate its area very easily.

The idea of integration is to divide the function into subsections, and then calculate each subsection's own area approximately by taking the area as if it were a rectangle, with the y level halfway through the subsection being taken for the rectangle's height.
