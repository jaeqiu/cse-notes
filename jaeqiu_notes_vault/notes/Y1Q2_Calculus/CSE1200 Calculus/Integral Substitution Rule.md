**The Substitution Rule**

![Exported image](Exported%20image%2020241209225528-0.png)

The integral of the composite function f âˆ˜ g (x) * g'(x) with respefct to dx is the same as  
the integral of f(u) with respect to du
 
Personally I found this to be more intuitive once I considered how g'(x) can be rewritten as d g ( x ) d ( x )  
, after which its substitution cancels out dx  
, leaving dg(x). With our substitution of g(x) as u  
, gives du.
