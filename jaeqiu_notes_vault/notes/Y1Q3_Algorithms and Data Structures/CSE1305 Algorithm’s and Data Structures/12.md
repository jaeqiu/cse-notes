Weighted graph

- edges have associated numerical value (weight of the edge)

Shortest path problem: given a weighted graph and vertices u and v, we want to find a path of minimum weight between u and v.
 
Breadth first search: gives path with lowest number of edges  
Not the shortest path

Dijkstra's algorithm
 
- Input: weighted graph and starting vertex s
- Output: map D[v] that gives the weight of the shortest path between s and any vertex v
 
- uses an adaptable priority queue
- picks vertex that is closest in terms of weight to the source
 
- For each vertex v, keep track of:
    
    - boolean that describes whether v has been visited
    - a label D[v] that contains the weight of the best path we have found so far
- Initially no node has been visited
    
    - D[s] = 0
    - D[v] = infinity, for each v != s
- Repeat until all nodes have been visited
    
    - pick unvisited vertex with least D[u] and mark as visited
    - 'relax D[v] for each edge(u,v) with weight w(u,v) as follows:

- When we do this, we don't keep track of path
    
    - Solution: keep track of parent

A tree is an undirected graph G such that

- G is connected
- G has no cycles
 
A spanning tree is a spanning subgraph that is a tree

- vertices are the same as original graph
- edges are subset of all edges of the original graph
 
Minimum spanning tree (MST): given an undirected, weighted graph G, we are interested in finding a spanning tree T of G that minimizes the sum

Example:  
Given some cities and the distances between those cities, how can we connect all cities with roads using the least amount of asphalt possible?

Kruskal's Algortihm

- Maintain a partition of the vertices into clusters
    
    - Initially, each vertex forms a single cluster
    - Each cluster contains a MST
- Pick an edge(u,v) with smallest weight that is not part of the MST yet
    
    - If clusters u and v are different: merge both using edge(u,v)
    - Otherwise remove edge
- Repeat until we have obtained a single cluster
 
Implemented using a PQ that stores the edges outisde clusters

- Keys: weights
- Elements: edges
