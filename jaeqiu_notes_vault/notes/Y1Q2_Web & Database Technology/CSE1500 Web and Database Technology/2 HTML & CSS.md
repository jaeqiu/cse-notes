A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).
 
Examples of block-level elements:
 
<div> - The <div> tag defines a division or a section in an HTML document.  
<h1> - <h6>  
<p>  
<form>  
<header>  
<footer>  
<section>
   

An inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.
 
Examples of inline elements:
 
<span> <a> <img>
   

///////////
 
visibility: hidden;  
display: none;
 
Visibility doesn't change lay-out. Display changes lay-our
